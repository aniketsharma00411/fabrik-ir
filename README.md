Problem statement:
Write a program to calculate Inverse Kinematics of a three-link manipulator robot using Fabrik technique.

INPUT:

It takes 6 values from user which are as follows:

    1. (space-seprated float) Initial position of joint 0
    2. (space-seprated float) Initial position of joint 1
    3. (space-seprated float) Initial position of joint 2
    4. (space-seprated float) Initial position of joint 3
    5. (space-seprated float) Goal position of end-effector
    6. (float) Tolerence

OUTPUT:

    1. (int) number of iterations taken by algorithm
    2. (list) New positions of joints
    3. (matplotlib plot) Graph showing initial joint positions, final joint positions and goal state
